In the reading material, it introduces two kinds of missing values:Explicitly(i.e. flagged with NA) and Implicitly(i.e. simply not present in the data).
What's more, it uses a clever way to explain the difference between those two misiing values:An explicit missing value is the presence of an absence; an implicit missing value is the absence of a presence.
Also, it provides some important tool for making missing values explicit in tidy data, such as complete().Complete() takes a set of columns, and finds all unique combinations. It then ensures the original dataset contains all those values, filling in explicit NAs where necessary.
For the another one, we can fill in those missing values with fill(). It takes a set of columns where you want missing values to be replaced by the most recent non-missing value (sometimes called last observation carried forward).
